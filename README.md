- this project is a free online app: **[Play Here](https://arabic-pronounciation.koljapluemer.com/)**

## Core Idea

> Before I can do any fancy experiments with learning Arabic, I need to be able to connect letters with sounds intuitively.

## Features

- prompts you to pronounce and copy random, short arabic words
- allows checking correct pronunciation afterwards â€” active recall approach
- at last, you can feedback how easy and correct an exercise was
    - this will be used for a Spaced Repetition approach later on, but not yet

## User Stories

* [x] As a learner, I want to practice the connection of Arabic letters, syllables or short words with the corresponding sounds in an efficient and fun manner.
* [ ] As an admin, I want to gather data about the learning success and research different SR ideas.
